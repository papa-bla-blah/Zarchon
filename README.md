## 🎮 What is Zarchon?

Zarchon combines two distinct gameplay modes:
1. **Strategic Phase:** Position units on a hex-grid board with terrain and elevation
2. **Combat Phase:** When units collide, battle in real-time arcade combat

Inspired by the classic Archon series, Zarchon modernizes the formula with:
- Two asymmetric factions (Tech vs Nature)
- Cross-platform play with input parity
- Hex-based terrain with tactical depth

## 🎯 Target Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Steam (Windows/Mac/Linux) | Primary |
| Google Play (Android) | Primary |
| Linux/Ubuntu | Supported |
| Raspberry Pi | Supported |
| Console | Future |

**Critical Requirement:** No input method (touch, mouse/keyboard, controller) should have an advantage over another.
